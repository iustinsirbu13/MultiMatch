# MultiMatch

This repository contains the code for the models described in [MultiMatch: Multihead Consistency Regularization Matching for Semi-Supervised Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07801) (Sirbu et al., EMNLP 2025).

The source code to reproduce the results is publicly available in a fork of the Unified Semi-supervised Learning ([USB](https://github.com/microsoft/Semi-supervised-learning)) framework at [https://github.com/iustinsirbu13/Semi-supervised-learning/tree/multimatch_tmp](https://github.com/iustinsirbu13/Semi-supervised-learning/tree/multimatch_tmp). This code is released under the MIT license, consistent with the original framework.


We have also submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/microsoft/Semi-supervised-learning/pull/254) to the official [USB repository](https://github.com/microsoft/Semi-supervised-learning) to integrate MultiMatch as a new algorithm, thereby contributing our work to the open-source community.
